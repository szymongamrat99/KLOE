# Charged vertex selection with the reconstruction of IP and boost correction

## Author: Szymon Gamrat
### Date of update: 03.02.2025

### Main assumptions

To reconstruct the charged decays registered in the KLOE experiment, the analysis porgram KchRec is used. It uses:
  - IV(ntv) --> vertices connected with two charged tracks
  - xv, yv, zv --> vertices' positions
  - CurV, PhiV, CotV --> curvature, azimuthal and polar angle of the tracks for the momenta reconstruction
  - IP --> average position of the interaction point from Bhabha events.
